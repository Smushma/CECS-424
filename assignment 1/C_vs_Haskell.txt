The main difference in why the C and Haskell implementations of the same algorithm are different is because the paradigms are different.
C is an imperative language while Haskell is a functional language. 
As a result, C consists a sequence of commands which will be executed one after another. 
Haskell consists of a "single expression," which is executed by evaluating the expression.
Thus, Haskell functions do not have "side effects" that imperative languages have.
Furethermore, variables in Haskell are immutable. Haskell is based on lambda calculus.
